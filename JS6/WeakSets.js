/* 
A WeakSet is just like a normal Set with a few key differences:

a WeakSet can only contain objects
a WeakSet is not iterable which means it canâ€™t be looped over
a WeakSet does not have a .clear() method
You can create a WeakSet just like you would a normal Set, except that you use the WeakSet constructor.
